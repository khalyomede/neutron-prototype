Enable adding method to a class on the fly.

```php
class Tableau extends Prototype {
  public $items;

  public function __construct($items = []) {
    $this->items = $items;
  }
}
```

```php
$tableau = new Tableau(['php', 'python', 'nodejs']);

$tableau->prototype('all', function() {
  return $this->items;
});

$languages = $tableau->all();
```

- [Examples of uses](#examples-of-uses)
- [Methods definition](#methods-definition)
- [MIT licence](#mit-licence)

## Prerequisites

This project is bounded to the following requirements you should be aware of:
- PHP >= 7.0.0
- Each class extending `Prototype` should not define the `__call` method
- Each class extending `Prototype` should not define the following method: `prototype()`
- Each class extending `Prototype` should not define the following static method: `prototypes()`
- Each properties you want your end developper to access via prototyping should be declared as `public` (and not `protected`)
- Each methods you want your end developper to access via prototyping should be declared as `public` (and note `private`)

## Installation

On your project folder, open a command prompt and type: 
```bash
composer require khalyomede/prototype:1.*
```

## Examples of uses

All these examples can be seen in `/example` folder.

- [Example 1: extending a class with a simple function](#example-1-extending-a-class-with-a-simple-function)
- [Example 2: extending a class with a simple method](#example-2-extending-a-class-with-a-simple-method)
- [Example 3: extending a class with a method with parameters](#example-3-extending-a-class-with-a-method-with-parameters)

For all these examples, we will assume we have a function called `Tableau` that simulate the behavior of PHP collections:

```php
namespace Me;

use Neutron\Prototype;

class Tableau extends Prototype {
  public $items

  public function __construct($items = []) {
    $this->items = $items;
  }

  public function all() {
    return $this->items;
  }
}
```

### Example 1: extending a class with a simple function

```php
use Me\Tableau;

$languages = ['php' => '7.2', 'python' => '3.6', 'nodejs' => '8.6'];

$tableau = new Tableau($languages);

$tableau->prototype('className', function() {
  return 'Tableau';
});

echo $tableau->className();
```

Will display:

```bash
Tableau
```

### Example 2: extending a class with a simple method

```php
use Me\Tableau;

$languages = ['php' => '7.2', 'python' => '3.6', 'nodejs' => '8.6'];

$tableau = new Tableau($languages);

$tableau->prototype('first', function() {
  return $this->items[key($this->items)];
});

$version = $tableau->first();

echo $version;
```

Will print:

```bash
7.2
```

### Example 3: extending a class with a method with parameters

```php
use Me\Tableau;

$languages = ['php' => '7.2', 'python' => '3.6', 'nodejs' => '8.6'];

$tableau = new Tableau($languages);

$tableau->prototype('find', function($key) {
  return isset($this->items[$key]) ? $this->items[$key] : null;
});

$python_version = $tableau->find('python');

echo $python_version;
```

Will echo:

```bash
3.6
```

## Methods definition

- [prototypes()](#prototypes)
- [prototype()](#prototype)

### Prototypes()

List all the registered prototypes. The list is shared across all the instance of your prototyped object.

```php
public static function prototypes(): array
```

### Prototype()

Register a new method for the object. This method can then be accessed across all your instances of the prototyped object.

```php
public function prototype(string $name, callable $function): Prototype
```

**Exceptions**

`InvalidArgumentException`: 

- If the name of the function is already used by the prototyped object
- If the prototype has already been registered for this object

`BadMethodCallException`:

- If the method (you thought you prototyped) has not been registered yet

**Note**

This function returns an instance of the current object.
