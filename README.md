# Neutron\Prototype

Enable adding method to a class on the fly.

## Summary
- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Examples of uses](#examples-of-uses)
- [Licence MIT](#licence)

## Prerequisites

This project is bounded to the following requirements you should be aware of:
- PHP >= 7.0.0
- Each class extending `Prototype` should not define the `__call` method
- Each class extending `Prototype` should not define the following method: `prototype()`
- Each class extending `Prototype` should not define the following static method: `prototypes()`
- Each properties you want your end developper to access via prototyping should be declared as `public` (and not `protected`)
- Each methods you want your end developper to access via prototyping should be declared as `public` (and note `private`)

## Installation

On your project folder, open a command prompt and type: 
```bash
composer require neutron/prototype:1.*
```

## Examples of uses

All these examples can be seen in `/example` folder.

- [Example 1 : extending a class with a simple function](#example-1--extending-a-class-with-a-simple-function)
- [Example 2 : extending a class with a simple method](#example-2--extending-a-class-with-a-simple-method)
- [Example 3 : extending a class with a method with parameters](#example-3--extending-a-class-with-a-method-with-parameters)

For all these examples, we will assume we have a function called `Tableau` that simulate the behavior of PHP collections:

```php
namespace Me;

use Neutron\Prototype;

class Tableau extends Prototype {
	public $items

	public function __construct($items = []) {
		$this->items = $items;
	}

	public function all() {
		return $this->items;
	}
}
```

### Example 1 : extending a class with a simple function

```php
use Me\Tableau;

$languages = ['php' => '7.2', 'python' => '3.6', 'nodejs' => '8.6']

$tableau = new Tableau($languages);

$tableau->prototype('className', function() {
	return 'Tableau';
});

echo $tableau->className();
```

Will display:

```bash
Tableau
```
